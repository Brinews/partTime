 * Description: The input is expected to consist of y_dim lines of x_dim       *
 *              members of {0, 1, 2, 3}, where x_dim and y_dim are at least    *
 *              equal to 2 and at most equal to MAX_X_DIM and MAX_Y_DIM,       *
 *              respectively, with possibly lines consisting of spaces only    *
 *              that will be ignored and with possibly spaces anywhere on the  *
 *              lines with digits.                                             *
 *              The xth digit n of the yth line, with 0 <= x < x_dim and       *
 *              0 <= y < y_dim, is to be associated with a point situated      *
 *              x * 0.5 cm to the right and y * 0.5 cm below an origin, is to  *
 *              be connected to the point 0.5 cm to its right                  *
 *              if n = 1 or n = 3, and is to be connected to the point         *
 *              0.5 cm below itself if n = 2 or n = 3.                         *
 *              The last digit on every line cannot be equal to 1 or 3, and    *
 *              the digits on the last line cannot be equal to 2 or 3, which   *
 *              ensures that the input encodes a maze, that is, a grid of      *
 *              width (x_dim - 1) * 0.5 cm and of height (y_dim - 1) * 0.5 cm, *
 *              with possibly gaps on the sides and inside. A point not        *
 *              connected to any of its neighbours is thought of as a pillar;  *
 *              a point connected to at least one of its neighbours is thought *
 *              of as part of a wall.                                          *
 *              We talk about "inner point" to refer to a point that lies      *
 *              (x + 0.5) * 0.5 cm to the right of and (y + 0.5) * 0.5 cm      *
 *              below the origin with 0 <= x < x_dim - 1 and                   *
 *              0 <= y < y_dim - 1.                                            *
 *                                                                             *
 *              Practically, the input will be stored in a file and its        *
 *              contents redirected to standard input. The program will be run *
 *              with either co command-line argument or with "print" as unique *
 *              command line argument; otherwise it will exit. The program     *
 *              will also exit immediately if the input is not as expected.    *
 *                                                                             *
 *              When provided with no command-line argument, the program does  *
 *              the following.                                                 *
 *              - It outputs the number of gates, that is, the number of       *
 *              consecutive points on one of the four sides of the maze   *
 *              that are not connected.                                        *
 *              - It outputs the number of sets of connected walls.            *
 *              - It outputs the number of inner points that cannot be         *
 *                accessed from any gate, starting from the point in the       *
 *                middle of a gate and going from inner points to neighbouring *
 *                inner points.                                                *
 *              - It outputs the number of maximal areas that can be accessed  *
 *                from at least one gate.                                      *
 *              - It outputs the number of accessible cul-de-sacs.             *
 *              - It outputs the number of paths consisting of inner points    *
 *                that go from a gate to another gate and such that the        *
 *                resulting path is choice-free, that is, such that leaving    *
 *                the path, at any inner point where that is possible,         *
 *                immediately leads into a cul-de-sac.                         *
 *                                                                             *
 *              When provided with "print" as unique command-line argument,    *
 *              the program outputs some .tex code to depict the maze          *
 *              as a tiz picture.                                              *
 *              - Walls are drawn in blue. There is a command for every        *
 *                longest segment that is part of a wall. Horizontal segments  *
 *                are drawn starting with the topmost leftmost segment and     *
 *                finishing with the bottommost rightmost segment. Then        *
 *                vertical segments are drawn starting with the topmost        *
 *                leftmost segment and finishing with the bottommost rightmost *
 *                segment.                                                     *
 *              - Pillars are drawn as green circles.                          *
 *              - Inner points in accessible cul-de-sacs are drawn as red      *
 *                crosses.                                                     *
 *              - The choice-free paths are drawn as dashed yellow lines.      *
 *                There is a command for every longest segment on such a       *
 *                path. Horizontal segments are drawn starting with the        *
 *                topmost leftmost segment and finishing with the bottommmost  *
 *                rightmost segment, with those segments that end at a gate    *
 *                sticking out by 0.25 cm. Then vertical segments are drawn    *
 *                starting with the topmost leftmost segment and finishing     *
 *                with the bottommmost rightmost segment, with those segments  *
 *                that end at a gate sticking out by 0.25 cm.                  *
 *                                                                             *
